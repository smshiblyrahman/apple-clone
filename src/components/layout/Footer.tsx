            1. Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and
            configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
            eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be
            eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in
            value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added
            to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a
            qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate
            was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device
            purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo
            ID (local law may require saving this information). Offer may not be
            available in all stores, and may vary between in-store and online
            trade-in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its
            trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or limit quantity of
            any trade-in transaction for any reason. More details are available
            from Apple's trade-in partner for trade-in and recycling of eligible
            devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.
